## Introduction

Programming Answers to the Programming in Haskell 2nd Edition book by Graham Hutton

The aim of this repo is to give aspiring Haskell developers some work to check theirs against when working through this book. This should **NOT** be used to cheat in any way.

>**Note:** It is not guaranteed that my way of completing the solutions is **THE** best way of completing them, it is just the best way **I CAN THINK OF** after what I have learnt in the chapter. Take this into consideration when you check your answers, you might have found the better way! I would be interested to discuss any other solutions.

I will aim to explain my working for each problem as best as I can, but if you have any questions, I implore you to ask them to whoever you have available. You can send me a DM on Twitter of LinkedIn, I will respond when I have the time.
